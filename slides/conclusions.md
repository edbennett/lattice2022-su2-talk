# Conclusions

-

## Summary

* Scalar glueball remains lightest state $\forall\beta$
* $\gamma_*$ continues to decrease as $\beta$ increases
* Results poorly described by chiral perturbation theory
* Possible interpretations:
  * QCD-like but $am$ too large
  * Conformal with scaling deviations
  * Conformal with strong influence from bulk phase
* At limits of where we can probe with this action

## Ongoing work

* Finalising analysis of these ensembles
* Preparing simulations using MÃ¶bius DWF
  * To reduce lattice artefacts towards chiral limit
